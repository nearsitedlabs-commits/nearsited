**Files:** [`dashboard-client.tsx`](src/app/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx:79-106)

#### 8.1 Use label maps for raw enums ✅
`PITCH_STATUS_LABELS` and `LEAD_TYPE_LABELS` in [`ui-constants.ts`](src/lib/ui-constants.ts:133-147). Pitches page uses `PITCH_STATUS_LABELS[pitch.pitch_status]` and `LEAD_TYPE_LABELS[pitch.lead_type]`.

---

### Batch 3 — Remaining tasks + audit sweep

#### 1.4 Verify sample card labeling ✅
Section eyebrow set to "SAMPLE OPPORTUNITY REPORT" at [`page.tsx:300`](src/app/page.tsx:300). The `SectionLabel` component applies CSS `uppercase`, so both render identically but source is more explicit.

**Files:** [`page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx:300)

#### 6.1 Fix Quick Audit timeout ✅
Already implemented. Verified:
1. **Timeout**: `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS = 90000` (90s) at [`route.ts:31`](src/app/api/audit/route.ts:31)

3. **Error panel**: "Couldn't reach the site" with Try Again + Try a Different URL at [`audit/page.tsx:658-696`](src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx:658)
4. **Disabled pitch**: "Generate Pitch (unavailable — audit failed)" with tooltip at [`audit/page.tsx:869-877`](src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx:869)

Fixed stale console log: `"timed out after 60s"` → `"timed out after ${REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS}ms"`.

**Checklist coverage:** Batch 2 Audit (#28-34) — empty state, URL typed, mid-analysis, successful completion, Generate Pitch, Add to Pipeline, Review Again.

**Files:** [`route.ts`](src/app/api/audit/route.ts:31), [`audit/page.tsx`](src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx:658)

#### 6.2 Test reliability before demo ⬜
MANUAL — Test 5 real URLs before any demo. Acceptance: 4/5 must complete within 90s.

#### 11.1 Verify Analyse button surfaces ✅
Code-audited across all surfaces:
- `/dashboard/leads` — Analyse (unanalysed with website), Re-analyse (analysed), "—" (no website)
- `/dashboard/discover` — Analyse (has_website/platform_only), Re-analyse (done), muted tag (no_website/social_only)
- `/dashboard/leads/[id]` — "Analyse Opportunity" chains audit → design with streaming progress

All use unified NDJSON streaming with step-by-step progress indicators and error/retry handling.

**Checklist coverage:** Batch 4 (#17-18) — Analyse complete inline update, failure/timeout state with retry.

#### Design system consistency ✅
- Sidebar: `#13131c` → `var(--bg-surface-2)`, `#0a0a0f` → `var(--bg-base)`, `white/5` → `var(--border)`
- Auth inputs/buttons: `rounded-xl` → `rounded-lg` (login + signup pages)
- Pitches delete: error handling with Toast notification

**Files:** [`layout.tsx`](src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx:14,72), [`login/page.tsx`](src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx:112,147,174), [`signup/page.tsx`](src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx:154,214,241), [`pitches/page.tsx`](src/app/dashboard/pitches/page.tsx:53-56)

## PER-ITEM CODE ANALYSIS — 70/70 Verified from Source

Each item traced through component code. **✅ = code-confirmed working** | **⚠️ = potential issue found** | **🔴 = needs manual test only**

### BATCH 1 — Lead Detail (`/dashboard/leads/[id]`)
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 46 | Mobile vs Desktop toggle — flip and screenshot both sides | ✅ | Toggle buttons at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:731-742`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:731). `screenshotStrategy` state switches `activeAudit`/`activeDesign` at line 226-227. Scores recompute reactively. |
| 47 | Audit tab — full layout | ✅ | `renderAudit()` at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:1031`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:1031). Shows Mobile + Desktop audit scores with FCP/LCP/TBT/CLS metrics. Empty state when no audits exist. |
| 48 | Issues tab — full layout | ✅ | `renderIssues()` at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:1085`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:1085). Shows all issues with ImpactPill + point deductions. Empty state when none. |
| 49 | History tab — full content | ✅ | `renderHistory()` at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:1115`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:1115). Shows audit + design analysis events with dates/scores. Empty state when none. |
| 50 | "Re-analyse" button click — progress state mid-run | ✅ | `handleFullAnalysis()` at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:500`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:500). Chains audit → design with NDJSON streaming. Progress checklist at line 1239-1268 with step-by-step done/active/pending states. |
| 51 | "Copy Pitch" button — what gets copied, toast | ✅ | `handleCopyPitch()` at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:328`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:328). Writes `pitchResult.body` to clipboard. Shows toast via `showToast("Pitch copied to clipboard")`. |
| 52 | Status dropdown open — all options, change + reload persist | ✅ | Select at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:1221-1229`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:1221). Maps `PIPELINE_STATUSES` (8 options). `handlePipelineChange()` does optimistic update + PATCH API call. Falls back to refetch on error. |
| 53 | "Generate Pitch" when lead is unanalysed — button disabled? | ⚠️ | Button at line 968-975 is NOT disabled based on audit data — only disabled when `generatingPitch===true`. `handleGeneratePitch()` requires `biz.id` but doesn't check for existing audit. If no audit data, the pitch API (`/api/pitch`) receives only `lead_type` — may produce low-quality pitch. Consider checking `biz.audited_at` to disable or warn. |
| 54 | Tone + Length dropdowns — all options | ✅ | Tone select at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:955-959`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:955): Professional, Friendly, Luxury. Length select at line 960-965: Short, Medium, Detailed. |
| 55 | After "Generate Pitch" completes — where output appears | ✅ | Pitch result renders inline at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:984-1003`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:984). Shows subject line + body text + Copy button. Appears below the Generate button in the same card. |
| 56 | PDF Report button click | ✅ | Link to `/api/export/pdf?businessId=${biz.id}` at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:1011-1016`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:1011). Direct download via `<a href>`. |
| 57 | Share Link button click | ✅ | `handleShare()` at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:339`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:339). POST to `/api/share`, receives URL, copies to clipboard, shows toast. |
| 58 | Shared link page in incognito | ✅ | [`share/[token]/page.tsx`](src/app/share/%5Btoken%5D/page.tsx) renders full report with business info, audit scores, design issues. Uses `notFound()` for invalid tokens. Admin client bypasses RLS. |
| 59 | Lead with no_website status | ✅ | `renderOverview()` at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:631`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:631). Shows "This lead hasn't been analysed yet" empty state with score breakdown (all nulls) and disabled Generate Pitch. No "Analyse Opportunity" button when `hasWebsite===false`. |
| 60 | Lead with multiple re-analyses — History tab entries | ✅ | `renderHistory()` at [`lead-detail-client.tsx:1115`](src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/lead-detail-client.tsx:1115). Iterates ALL audit + design analysis rows. Each re-analysis creates new DB rows, so they show as separate events. |

### BATCH 2 — Quick Audit (`/dashboard/audit`)
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 28 | Empty initial state | ✅ | Page at [`audit/page.tsx:452-491`](src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx:452). Shows heading, subtitle, URL input with Globe icon, and "Review Opportunity" button. Clean idle state. |
| 29 | URL typed, before pressing Run Audit | ✅ | Button at line 480 disabled when `!url.trim()`. Input updates `url` state via `onChange`. Enter key triggers `handleRun()`. |
| 30 | Mid-analysis — partial progress | ✅ | Progress checklist at [`audit/page.tsx:590-622`](src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx:590). Shows 9 steps with CheckCircle2 (done), Loader2 (active), Circle (pending) icons. |
| 31 | Successful completion — both Mobile and Desktop scores | ✅ | Results render at [`audit/page.tsx:700-837`](src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx:700). Performance + SEO scores, FCP/LCP/TBT/CLS metrics. Design analysis scores + issues. |
| 32 | "Generate Pitch" click | ✅ | `handleGeneratePitch()` at [`audit/page.tsx:327`](src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx:327). POST to `/api/pitch` with audit + design data. Result appears in "Pitch Preview" card below the button. |
| 33 | "Add to Pipeline" click | ✅ | `handleAddToPipeline()` at [`audit/page.tsx:363`](src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx:363). POST to `/api/pipeline`. Button state changes to "Added" with green check. Shows error on failure. |
| 34 | "Review Again" with same URL — cache or re-run | ✅ | "New Search" button at [`audit/page.tsx:538-557`](src/app/dashboard/audit/page.tsx:538) clears all state + sessionStorage. "Review Again" at line 580 re-runs via `handleRun()`. SessionStorage restores previous result on page load (line 128-152). |

### BATCH 3 — Dashboard
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 5 | Zero-leads empty state | ✅ | `totalLeads === 0` at [`dashboard-client.tsx:79-106`](src/app/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx:79). Shows "Find your first opportunity" card with Search icon + "Start Discovering →" CTA. |
| 6 | Dashboard with analysed lead — right preview panel | ✅ | **Option B implemented** — right preview panel removed entirely at [`dashboard-client.tsx`](src/app/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx). Dashboard uses full-width layout (no left/right column split). |
| 7 | Click "Recent Opportunities" row | ✅ | Each row at [`dashboard-client.tsx:181-183`](src/app/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx:181) is a `<Link href={/dashboard/leads/${lead.id}}>`. Navigates to Lead Detail. |
| 8 | "All Opportunities" button | ✅ | Link at [`dashboard-client.tsx:121-125`](src/app/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx:121) routes to `/dashboard/leads`. |
| 9 | Credits widget at/near zero | ⚠️ | Credits widget at [`layout.tsx:36-53`](src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx:36) shows hardcoded "100 / 100" with full progress bar. No zero/low-credits state — no warning, no disabled features. "Buy More Credits" button is always disabled (`cursor-not-allowed`). Feature gating when credits hit 0 is not implemented. |

### BATCH 4 — Opportunity Discovery (`/dashboard/discover`)
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 10 | After pressing "Find Businesses" — loading/streaming state | ✅ | Loading skeleton at [`discover/page.tsx:1107-1140`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:1107). Animated pulse bars with staggered delays. Button shows spinner + "Finding…". |
| 11 | Zero results | ✅ | Empty state at [`discover/page.tsx:1503-1513`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:1503). Shows "No opportunities in this area" with suggestion to try different city/radius. |
| 12 | Invalid city input | ✅ | Error banner at [`discover/page.tsx:1099-1103`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:1099). Shows the API error message in red. Also handled at line 738-744: API returns error with status 400+. |
| 13 | Radius slider — updates live | ✅ | Range input at [`discover/page.tsx:1016-1024`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:1016). Updates `radiusMeters` state on `onChange`. Label updates live: `${(radiusMeters / 1000).toFixed(0)} km`. |
| 14 | "+ Add" button after click — visual confirmation | ✅ | `handleAddToPipeline()` at [`discover/page.tsx:613`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:613). Shows spinner + "Adding…" during request. |
| 15 | Row after pipeline add — state change | ✅ | `isInPipeline` at [`discover/page.tsx:1224`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:1224) checks `pipelineIds` set. Button changes to "Remove" in red. |
| 16 | Shuffle/random button | ✅ | `handleRandomize()` at [`discover/page.tsx:392`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:392). Picks random city from `getOrderedCities()` + random business type from `businessTypes`. |
| 17 | "Analyse Opportunity" complete — inline update | ✅ | `handleAnalyseOpportunity()` at [`discover/page.tsx:402`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:402). Updates result via `setResults()` at line 473-478. Score ring populates from `audit.mobile.performance_score`. |
| 18 | Analyse failure/timeout — retry button | ✅ | Error phase at [`discover/page.tsx:597-606`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:597) sets `step: "error"`. UI renders "Retry" button at line 1397-1404 with error tooltip. |
| 19 | "Save this search" — where saved, how retrieved | ✅ | `SaveSearchDialog` at [`discover/page.tsx:1517-1601`](src/app/dashboard/discover/page.tsx:1517). POST to `/api/saved-searches`. Retrieved via "Saved ({count})" dropdown that fetches from `/api/saved-searches`. Appears in Settings. |

### BATCH 5a — Sign-in / Sign-up
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Wrong password error | ✅ | Error set at [`login/page.tsx:56`](src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx:56). Rendered via `AuthCard` `error` prop at line 59-63. Shows red banner with error message. |
| 2 | Sign-up page | ✅ | Separate page at [`signup/page.tsx`](src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx). Full form with name + email + password + Google OAuth. Success state shows "Check your email" confirmation. |
| 3 | Forgot password flow | 🔴 | **Not implemented.** No "Forgot password" link in either login or signup forms. Users cannot reset passwords. |
| 4 | Google OAuth click | ✅ | `handleGoogleLogin()` at [`login/page.tsx:64`](src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx:64) and [`signup/page.tsx:67`](src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx:67). Opens Google OAuth popup with redirect to `/auth/callback`. |

### BATCH 5b — Pipeline (`/dashboard/pipeline`)
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 35 | Status dropdown open — all stages | ✅ | Select at [`pipeline/page.tsx:195-203`](src/app/dashboard/pipeline/page.tsx:195). Maps `STATUS_OPTIONS` (all 8 pipeline statuses with labels). |
| 36 | Change status → reload — persists | ✅ | `handleStatusChange()` at [`pipeline/page.tsx:84`](src/app/dashboard/pipeline/page.tsx:84). Optimistic update + PATCH to `/api/pipeline`. Falls back to full refetch on error. |
| 37 | Row click — navigate to Lead Detail | ⚠️ | Rows at [`pipeline/page.tsx:172-210`](src/app/dashboard/pipeline/page.tsx:172) are `<tr>` elements with NO link wrapper. The "→ Analyse" link at line 183 navigates to Lead Detail, but clicking the row itself does nothing. Consider making the row clickable. |
| 38 | Score "—" row — unanalysed pipeline entry | ✅ | `ScoreRing` at [`pipeline/page.tsx:180`](src/app/dashboard/pipeline/page.tsx:180) receives `item.performance_score` which is null. ScoreRing renders ghost ring with "—" for null scores. |
| 39 | Empty pipeline | ✅ | Empty state at [`pipeline/page.tsx:149-159`](src/app/dashboard/pipeline/page.tsx:149). Shows "No businesses yet" with link to Discover. |

### BATCH 5c — Pitches (`/dashboard/pitches`)
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 40 | Click pitch body — expand, navigate, or nothing | ⚠️ | Pitch cards at [`pitches/page.tsx:95-131`](src/app/dashboard/pitches/page.tsx:95) are NOT clickable. Body is truncated via `line-clamp-2`. No expand functionality. |
| 41 | Copy button — toast, icon change | ✅ | `handleCopy()` at [`pitches/page.tsx:47`](src/app/dashboard/pitches/page.tsx:47). Writes `Subject: ${pitch.subject}\n\n${pitch.body}` to clipboard. Icon changes from Copy to Check. |
| 42 | Delete button — confirmation dialog | ⚠️ | `handleDelete()` at [`pitches/page.tsx:53`](src/app/dashboard/pitches/page.tsx:53) deletes immediately — **no confirmation dialog**. Now shows Toast on success/failure (recent fix), but destructive action lacks user confirmation. |
| 43 | After generating from Lead Detail — appears here immediately? | ⚠️ | Pitches page fetches data on mount via `useEffect` at [`pitches/page.tsx:32-45`](src/app/dashboard/pitches/page.tsx:32). No real-time subscription. Requires manual refresh or navigation to see new pitches. |
| 44 | Empty Pitches state | ✅ | Empty state at [`pitches/page.tsx:82-89`](src/app/dashboard/pitches/page.tsx:82). Shows FileText icon + "No pitches yet." with link to Discover. |
| 45 | "sent" or "replied" status | ✅ | `STATUS_STYLES` at [`pitches/page.tsx:20-24`](src/app/dashboard/pitches/page.tsx:20) defines sent (blue) and replied (green) styles. `PITCH_STATUS_LABELS` at [`ui-constants.ts:133-137`](src/lib/ui-constants.ts:133) maps all 3 statuses. |

### BATCH 5d — Settings (`/dashboard/settings`)
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 61 | Click each integration row | ⚠️ | Integration rows at [`settings/page.tsx:111-124`](src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx:111) are plain `<div>` elements. Not interactive — no click handler, no config dialog. Display-only. |
| 62 | Sign out → result | ✅ | `SignOutButton` at [`settings/page.tsx:134`](src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx:134). Renders sign-out button. Uses Supabase auth sign-out. |
| 63 | "Buy More Credits" click | ⚠️ | Button at [`layout.tsx:47-52`](src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx:47) has `cursor-not-allowed` + `disabled` attribute. Does nothing. No Stripe integration yet. |

### BATCH 5e — Cross-cutting Edge Cases
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 64 | "1 Issue ×" red badge — click it | ✅ | **Not found in codebase.** Identified as Next.js dev-mode error/warning count indicator. Disappears in production builds (`npm run build && npm start`). |
| 65 | Sidebar at narrow viewport (1024px) | ⚠️ | Sidebar at [`layout.tsx:14`](src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx:14) is fixed `w-60` with NO responsive breakpoint. No collapse/hide behavior at any viewport width. |
| 66 | Mobile-width viewport | ⚠️ | Same as #65. No responsive layout. Main content area has `overflow-auto` but sidebar remains fixed width. |
| 67 | Click "Coming Soon" sidebar item | ✅ | Items removed (Task 11.2). Sidebar at [`sidebar-nav.tsx`](src/app/dashboard/sidebar-nav.tsx) shows only 7 active nav items. No Coming Soon section exists. |
| 68 | Toast notifications | ✅ | [`Toast.tsx`](src/components/ui/Toast.tsx) component renders at `fixed bottom-6 right-6`. Used in lead-detail, discover, pitches (via `showToast` pattern). Auto-dismisses after 3s. Green checkmark + message. |
| 69 | Error states | ✅ | Every data-fetching page has error state: leads (line 459), discover (line 1099), pipeline (line 120), audit (line 493), pitches (via delete error). API routes return structured error responses. |
| 70 | Loading skeleton states | ✅ | Every data-fetching page has skeleton/loading: leads (line 444-457), discover (line 1107-1140), pipeline (line 109-118), pitches (line 58-67), settings (line 35-44), lead detail (per-action spinners). |

### BATCH 6 — Opportunities List (`/dashboard/leads`)
| # | Item | Verdict | Code Evidence |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 20 | "View" button — navigation | ✅ | View button at [`leads/page.tsx:751-757`](src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx:751) is a `<Link href={/dashboard/leads/${lead.id}}>`. Navigates to Lead Detail. |
| 21 | Analysed card with real score | ✅ | ScoreRing at [`leads/page.tsx:681`](src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx:681) renders `effectiveScore(lead)`. Status badge at line 197-212 uses `opportunityLabel()` + `opportunityBadgeVariant()` for color-coded labels. |
| 22 | Each filter tab result | ✅ | 4 tabs at [`leads/page.tsx:55-60`](src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx:55). Filter logic at line 402-404: `needs_improvement` (score 40-69), `strong_opportunity` (score ≥70), `contacted` (contacted/in_conversation). |
| 23 | Search bar in use | ✅ | Search input at [`leads/page.tsx:543-551`](src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx:543). Filters by name/city/business_type at line 408-411. Search-specific empty state at line 154-166 shows "No results for {query}". |
| 24 | Sort dropdown — all options | ✅ | Sort select at [`leads/page.tsx:554-563`](src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx:554). Options: Opportunity Score, Raw Score, Name, Discovered. Sort direction toggle (↑ Asc / ↓ Desc). |
| 25 | "Filters" button open — panel content | ✅ | Filter panel at [`leads/page.tsx:574-643`](src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx:574). Contains: Website status select, Order select, Sort by select, Score Range slider, Audited checkbox, Analysed checkbox, Include archived checkbox. |
| 26 | Page 2 and last page — pagination | ✅ | Pagination at [`leads/page.tsx:787-804`](src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx:787). 25 per page. Prev/next buttons disabled at boundaries. Page saved to `sessionStorage`. Shows "Showing X–Y of Z". |
| 27 | "New Search" button | ✅ | Link at [`leads/page.tsx:486-491`](src/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx:486) routes to `/dashboard/discover`. |
